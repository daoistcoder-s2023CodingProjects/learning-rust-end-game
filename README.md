## 🏆 Goals
* Develop a solid foundation in Rust syntax and semantics. This could involve learning about Rust's type system, ownership and borrowing model, and common language features such as enums, traits, and macro expansion.
* Build practical skills in using Rust for common tasks such as networking, concurrency, and system programming. This could involve working through exercises and projects that involve using Rust to build command-line tools, servers, and other systems-level applications.
* Gain a deeper understanding of Rust's underlying design principles and how they influence the language's behavior and performance characteristics. This could involve reading the Rust documentation and blog posts, participating in online communities such as the Rust forums and subreddit, and exploring topics such as Rust's runtime and memory model.

## ⏱️ Timeline
### Week 1
* Learn Rust fundamentals (including Reference and Borrowing, Data Types, Functions, Collections, Variables, etc)
* Familiarize myself with rust environment tools such as cargo and IntelliJ
### Week 2
* Create a very basic Rust project
* Dive deeper into intermediate Rust concepts such as collections, traits, and error handling
### Week 3
* Build Web APIs in Rust
* Explore Rust unit testing
### Week 4
* Explore deploying Rust projects in the cloud (e.g. on AWS)
* Build an NFT minting page with Rust as the backend
